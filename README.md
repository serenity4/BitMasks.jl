Utility package aimed at manipulating enumeration values as bitmasks. Bitmasks are combinations of boolean flags encoded as specific bits of an integer type. For example, 8 flags can be represented with a `UInt8`, from `0b1000000` to `0b00000001`. A bitmask instance could then have a value of `0b10101101` in this case.

This package provides a way to define bitmasks from bit values and bitmask presets, such as

```julia
julia> using Bitmasks

julia> @bitmask Mask::UInt32 begin
  # Flags.
  BIT_A = 1
  BIT_B = 2
  BIT_C = 4

  # Mask presets.
  BIT_AB = 3
  BIT_BC = 6
  BIT_ABC = 7
end
Mask
```

Mask presets are optional, but can be handy to group parameters especially when specific masks have a strong semantic meaning or when the number of flags is very large. The right-hand sides of the `=` assignments are required to be integer literals at the moment.

It is also possible to combine flags or masks to create new masks, for example

```
julia> BIT_A | BIT_C
Mask(BIT_A | BIT_C)

julia> BIT_A | BIT_B
Mask(BIT_AB)

julia> ~BIT_A
Mask(BIT_BC)

julia> BIT_BC âŠ» BIT_AB
Mask(BIT_A | BIT_C)

julia> BIT_BC & BIT_C
Mask(BIT_C)
```

where `|` performs the union of different flags or masks, `&` their intersection, `~` their complement and `xor` the complement of their intersection. Note that `|` should be read as `and` instead of `or` from a semantic perspective.

You will have noticed that a specific printing is defined which will try to compact all combinations based on the provided presets to reduce verbosity.

Other utilities are defined, such as the extraction of all flags from a mask, conversion to/from integers and bits of extra type safety to avoid mixing flags coming from different masks:

```
julia> enabled_flags(BIT_ABC)
3-element Vector{Mask}:
 Mask(BIT_A)
 Mask(BIT_B)
 Mask(BIT_C)

julia> Int(BIT_A)
1

julia> Mask(1)
Mask(BIT_A)

julia> @bitmask Mask2::UInt32 begin
         BIT_A_2 = 1
         BIT_B_2 = 2
         BIT_AB_2 = 3
       end
Mask2

julia> BIT_A | BIT_B_2
ERROR: Bitwise operation not allowed between incompatible bitmasks 'Mask', 'Mask2'
```

Finally, a few common `Base` methods were added for convenience:

```
julia> zero(Mask)
Mask()

julia> iszero(zero(Mask))
true

julia> typemax(Mask)
Mask(BIT_ABC)
```
